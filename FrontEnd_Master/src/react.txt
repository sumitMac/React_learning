If you want to react element in ReactDOM u need to use to createElement method
But IN JSX u do not need to createElement jsx automatically  convert jsx in to html elements.
React have known for one way data flow.(Why its good idea)Because for bugging and and debugging Because we know child doesn't cause problem in parent only parent mess with child for debugging get easy.
