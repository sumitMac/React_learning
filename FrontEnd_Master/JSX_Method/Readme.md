# Dev_dependencies =>

# prettier
// Added for code format and you also use Extension(prettier).

# eslint-config-prettier
// Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

This lets you use your favorite shareable config without letting its stylistic choices get in the way when using Prettier.

Note that this config only turns rules off, so it only makes sense using it together with some other config. (link https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier for Installation)

# Hooks

# React query and TanStack (https://tanstack.com/query/v4)
TanStack Query (FKA React Query) is often described as the missing data-fetching library for web applications, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your web applications a breeze.

# Mutations (https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/mutations)
useMutation (hook provided by TanStack Query).
Mutation Side Effects=>
useMutation comes with some helper options that allow quick and easy side-effects at any stage during the mutation lifecycle. These come in handy for both invalidating and refetching queries after mutations and even optimistic updates.
