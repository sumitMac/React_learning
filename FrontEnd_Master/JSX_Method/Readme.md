# Dev_dependencies =>
# prettier
// Added for code format and you also use Extension(prettier).
# eslint-config-prettier
// Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

This lets you use your favorite shareable config without letting its stylistic choices get in the way when using Prettier.

Note that this config only turns rules off, so it only makes sense using it together with some other config. (link https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier for Installation)
